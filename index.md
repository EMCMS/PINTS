# **PINTS Hub**
## Pipelines for Non-Target Screening

The **PINTS Hub** provides a centralized, go-to location for the latest developments in Non-Target Screening (NTS) workflows for both developers and users. Our core mission is to promote the **standardization of NTS workflows** by moving the field from relying on single, often manual, algorithms to fully integrated and automated pipelines.

## Core Principles of the PINTS initiative

The hub is designed to minimize human intervention and maximize efficiency in NTS research. The key characteristics of the PINTS solution include:

* **Language and Field Agnostic:** The system is designed to integrate tools regardless of the programming language or scientific field.
* **Automated and Continuous Integration (CI):** This enables the building of complex pipelines by combining different algorithms in a streamlined manner.
* **Automated Performance Reporting:** Provides transparent and objective metrics on tool performance.
* **Fostering Collaboration:** The hub encourages and supports collaborative projects over single-developer efforts.

## The Three Steps to Standardization

The development and deployment of the PINTS Hub are structured around three critical steps:

### **Step 1: Standard Reporting**
This foundational step involves defining the required and recommended outputs for NTS algorithms:
* Establishing a set of **obligatory output parameters**.
* Defining a list of **good to have parameters** (e.g., peak quality metrics).
* Defining the **semantics** and structure of these reports to ensure interoperability.

### **Step 2: Automated Testing via CI**
This step ensures the quality and performance of integrated algorithms:
* Creating a robust **dataset** for testing.
* Building the **Continuous Integration (CI) setup** to automatically run tests.
* Implementing a system to **store the reports** of these automated tests.

### **Step 3: Creation of an Agnostic Hub**
This final step involves deploying the platform for the community:
* Developing the **backend of the hub**.
* Creating the **reporting display/dashboard** for user visualization.
* Managing the **final deployment** of the integrated system.

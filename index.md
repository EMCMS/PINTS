# **PINTS Hub**
## Pipelines for Non-Target Screening

[cite_start]The **PINTS Hub** provides a centralized, go-to location for the latest developments in Non-Target Screening (NTS) workflows for both developers and users[cite: 95]. [cite_start]Our core mission is to promote the **standardization of NTS workflows** by moving the field from relying on single, often manual, algorithms to fully integrated and automated pipelines[cite: 50, 59].

## Core Principles of the PINTS Solution

[cite_start]The hub is designed to minimize human intervention and maximize efficiency in NTS research[cite: 74]. The key characteristics of the PINTS solution include:

* **Language and Field Agnostic:** The system is designed to integrate tools regardless of the programming language or scientific field[cite: 71].
* [cite_start]**Automated and Continuous Integration (CI):** This enables the building of complex pipelines by combining different algorithms in a streamlined manner[cite: 72, 97].
* [cite_start]**Automated Performance Reporting:** Provides transparent and objective metrics on tool performance[cite: 73].
* **Fostering Collaboration:** The hub encourages and supports collaborative projects over single-developer efforts[cite: 96].

## The Three Steps to Standardization

The development and deployment of the PINTS Hub are structured around three critical steps[cite: 75, 79, 83]:

### **Step 1: Standard Reporting**
This foundational step involves defining the required and recommended outputs for NTS algorithms:
* [cite_start]Establishing a set of **obligatory output parameters**[cite: 76].
* [cite_start]Defining a list of **good to have parameters** (e.g., peak quality metrics)[cite: 77].
* Defining the **semantics** and structure of these reports to ensure interoperability[cite: 78].

### **Step 2: Automated Testing via CI**
This step ensures the quality and performance of integrated algorithms:
* [cite_start]Creating a robust **dataset** for testing[cite: 80].
* [cite_start]Building the **Continuous Integration (CI) setup** to automatically run tests[cite: 81].
* Implementing a system to **store the reports** of these automated tests[cite: 82].

### **Step 3: Creation of an Agnostic Hub**
This final step involves deploying the platform for the community:
* [cite_start]Developing the **backend of the hub**[cite: 84].
* [cite_start]Creating the **reporting display/dashboard** for user visualization[cite: 85].
* Managing the **final deployment** of the integrated system[cite: 86].

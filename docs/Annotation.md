# Feature Detection Overview

**LC-HRMS feature detection** algorithms transform the complex raw mass spectrometry data (a map of mass-to-charge (*m/z*), retention time (RT), and intensity) into a list of quantifiable, discrete **features** (representing chemical compounds). The typical processing steps include:

1.  **Mass Detection/Peak Picking:** Identifying individual ions in each spectrum.
2.  **Chromatogram Construction:** Generating Extracted Ion Chromatograms (EICs).
3.  **Chromatographic Peak Detection:** Identifying peaks within the EICs.


## Data Types in Feature Detection

The data type is a critical parameter for selecting a feature detection algorithm:

* **Profile Data:** The raw output where a single ion is represented by a distribution of data points (the "peak shape"). Algorithms like **SAFD** and **OpenMS's IsotopeWavelet** are designed to use this information.
* **Centroided Data:** Simplified data where the ion's $m/z$ distribution is reduced to a single representative value and its intensity. This is the common input for algorithms like **XCMS's centWave** and **KPIC**.

## Defintions: 

The **Allotrope Foundation Ontology (AFO)** and the **Allotrope Simple Model (ASM)** define a standardized, semantic vocabulary for analytical data, ensuring interoperability between software tools. The key input and output parameters used in feature detection are formally defined within this framework. It should be noted that these Property are by no means exhustive and we invite the developers to to contribute to this list.

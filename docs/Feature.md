# Feature Detection Overview

**LC-HRMS feature detection** algorithms transform the complex raw mass spectrometry data (a map of mass-to-charge ($m/z$), retention time (RT), and intensity) into a list of quantifiable, discrete **features** (representing chemical compounds). The typical processing steps include:

1.  **Mass Detection/Peak Picking:** Identifying individual ions in each spectrum.
2.  **Chromatogram Construction:** Generating Extracted Ion Chromatograms (EICs).
3.  **Chromatographic Peak Detection:** Identifying peaks within the EICs.
4.  **Feature Grouping:** Combining related chromatographic peaks (isotopes, adducts) across $m/z$ and RT dimensions into a single "feature."
5.  **Alignment:** Correcting for minor RT shifts between samples.

## Data Types in Feature Detection

The data type is a critical parameter for selecting a feature detection algorithm:

* **Profile Data:** The raw output where a single ion is represented by a distribution of data points (the "peak shape"). Algorithms like **SAFD** and **OpenMS's IsotopeWavelet** are designed to use this information.
* **Centroided Data:** Simplified data where the ion's $m/z$ distribution is reduced to a single representative value and its intensity. This is the common input for algorithms like **XCMS's centWave** and **KPIC**.

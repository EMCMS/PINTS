# Feature Prioritization

After feature extraction and componentization, **prioritization** represents the strategic approach for filtering and ranking compound features or components of interest, guiding subsequent annotation and identification efforts. Prioritization is applied to Non-Targeted Screening (NTS) pipelines and involves various methods and tools to rank features based on their chemical and structural signatures, statistical significance from the study design, or effect-directed properties such as predicted toxicity.

Prioritization can occur at two main points in the NTS pipeline:

1.  **Online (During Data Acquisition):** Often implemented using inclusion/exclusion lists and Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA). These approaches rely heavily on user interest and instrument-specific control, but they can reduce the MS2 chemical coverage and are less represented in comprehensive NTS pipelines where Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) is common.
2.  **Offline (Post Hoc Data Processing):** These strategies involve post hoc analysis of MS1 and MS2 data and are distinguished as **feature-based** or **fragmentation-based**. They leverage both the multiplicity of components in acquired data and the study design structure, supporting a wider range of approaches and better adaptation to open-source strategies.

## Prioritization Methods and Tools üõ†Ô∏è

Offline strategies‚Äîwhich leverage MS1 (feature) or MS2 (fragmentation) data‚Äîoffer high flexibility and are typically preferred in open-source NTS pipelines.

| Category | Approach Name | Description | Leveraged Data/Properties |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Online (DDA-based)** | **Intensity filters/TopN** | Real-time MS2 triggering during a duty cycle, prioritizing the most intense components. | Real-time intensity, DDA trigger |
| **Online (List-based)** | **Inclusion/Exclusion lists** | Use pre-determined $m/z$ or post-hoc generated lists from recorded MS1 data to guide DDA. | Pre-determined $m/z$ lists |
| **Online (Structure-based)** | **Isotopic abundance & ratio** | Real-time determination of isotopic patterns to prioritize chemicals containing specific elements (e.g., Cl, Br). | Isotope pattern, Real-time $m/z$ |
| **Offline (Feature-based)** | **Rule-based filtering** | Simple filters based on measured properties like intensity thresholding (noisy feature removal) or mass defect filters. | Intensity, Mass Defect, $m/z$ |
| **Offline (Feature-based)** | **Differential analysis** | Pattern recognition using unsupervised/supervised multivariate analysis or longitudinal trend analysis based on the study design. | Statistical significance, Study design structure |
| **Offline (Fragmentation-based)** | **Prioritization lists** | Filtering based on structure-based lists of chemicals that share similar functional groups, moieties, or specific elements. | Chemical structure, Elemental composition |
| **Offline (Fragmentation-based)** | **Structural/Molecular Motifs** | Prioritizing features that exhibit characteristic mass differences, often indicative of common metabolic or environmental modifications. | Mass differences, Fragmentation patterns |
| **Offline (Fragmentation-based)** | **Quantitative Structure‚ÄìActivity Relationship (QSAR)** | Ranking putative identifications based on predicted toxicity, hazard estimates, or other structure-derived properties. | Predicted hazard, Molecular structure |

# Additional Resources:

## Definitions: 

Outputs must include a string for the prioritization category and/or boolean value for the prioritization result, ensuring excluded features are preserved. This list of properties is harmonized with the former feature detection steps for an open NTS pipeline.

| Property | Semantic Term (Allotrope Context) | Property Role | Units | Description | 
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| prior | **Prioritization category/prediction** | **Essential** output | NA | Either a value predicted based on a model (e.g. LC50), rank of the components, or category. |
| Qp | **Prioritization quality** | **Additional** output | NA | An uncertainty or prediction quality parameter. |
